<h2>A Bit About This Project</h2>

This project is part of Gordon Zhu's <a href="https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript" class="section--link">Watch and Code</a> JavaScript series. I was working alone at the lab one day listening to <a href="http://frontendhappyhour.com/" class="section--link">Front-End Happy Hour</a> and heard about his online courses and decided to give it a go. This course makes sure you understand core fundamentals before teaching more advanced concepts. I highly recommend this course as a jumping off point for beginners. I have not tried out the paid version of the course, and maybe I will after I finish up Kyle Simpsons <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS" class="section--link" target="_blank">"You Don't Know JavaScript"</a> books.

There's nothing particulary fancy about my current iteration of the program. It's a simple To-Do List which I plan to update should I find the time. Hopefully that will happen sooner or later. The JavaScript is the same from the course however I have applied some styling to purty it up. 

I have included all the my files from my time taking this course. This includes my notes and other variations I created for practice. The notes include breakdowns of the changes for each video. Each note also includes the full code for that section at the bottom. The practice files are only partially completed. One day I may revisit them but not in the near future.
