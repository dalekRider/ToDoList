<h2>A Bit About This Project</h2>

This project is part of Gordon Zhu's <a href="https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript" class="section--link">Watch and Code</a> JavaScript series. I was working alone at the lab one day listening to <a href="http://frontendhappyhour.com/" class="section--link">Front-End Happy Hour</a> and heard about his online classes and decided to give it a go. This course makes sure you understand core fundamentals before teaching more advanced concepts. I highly recommend this course as a jumping off point for most people. I have not tried out the paid version of the course, and maybe I will after I finish up Kyle Simpsons <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS" class="section--link" target="_blank">"You Don't Know JavaScript"</a> books.

There's nothing particulary fancy about this program. It's a simple To-Do List which I plan to update should I find the time. Hopefully that will happen sooner or later. The JavaScript is the same from the course however I have styled the page up a bit to make it look nicer. There are some practice files I was tweaking for sandwich options type deal, but as it progressed I thought about changing up the purpose. One day I may mess with it but mostly likely it will just end in the JavaScript practice pile never to be seen again.

The files also contain notes taken during the course. At the bottom of each file should be the completed version for that particular section of the course. Please feel free to ask any questions you may have.
